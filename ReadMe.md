# **HOW TO USE**

Just run the executable and follow what it says. You will have to input the full file path unless the executable is in the same directory as the file, then you may use relative paths. Javascript is included but not needed, you can use it to make modifications to the script but you'll have to create a new executable if you wish to be able to use a .exe file to run it. You can change the directory of the exe if you want as well and it won't have any effect on how it runs. Feel free to mess around with it and provide feedback so I can improve it. Enjoy!
